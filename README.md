# Solid-Waste-Management-System

## INTRODUCTION

Waste management involves the collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal
of waste to minimize its impact on the environment and human health. It covers
various waste types, including municipal solid waste, hazardous waste, industrial
waste, and e-waste. The goal is to reduce waste generation and promote
sustainability through recycling, reusing, and proper disposal. 

Key strategies include the waste hierarchy, which prioritizes prevention and recycling, and the circular
economy, which focuses on maximizing the use of resources. Effective waste
management is vital for sustainable development, conserving natural resources,
and reducing pollution for a cleaner environment.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
At TakaTaka Solutions, waste is classified into eight categories:
Plastic, metal, food organics, vegetation, miscellaneous trash,
textiles, glass and paper. The manual process of sorting waste
introduces errors, such as misclassifying items, leading to
inefficiencies in recycling operations and increased waste sent
to landfills. There is a pressing need for an automated system
that can accurately classify waste images into these categories,
reducing human error and improving the overall recycling rate.

## OBJECTIVES
To develop an automated system that accurately classifies waste into eight
categories: plastic, metal, food organics, vegetation, miscellaneous trash,
textiles, glass, and paper, minimizing human errors in the sorting process.

To reduce inefficiencies in recycling operations caused by the manual
misclassification of waste items, enhancing the accuracy of waste
categorization.
